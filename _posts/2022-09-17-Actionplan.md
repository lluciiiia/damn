 Overall, a large range of information relevant to science and technology became familiar for me after ‘Introduction to Science and Technology’ lectures, especially coding is no longer terribly difficult for me by learning how to set up my own Github site. My desire for my major became stronger and stronger and it makes me eager for the best career in the future. For my professional knowledge in this area, I will join the ‘Neo culture technology’ club introduced once in an early lecture so that I can be versatile in all technology fields. Moreover, before entering university, I will practice ‘C language’ by myself with a related book that I bought from my country and various lectures on Youtube in order to reduce possible difficulties that I can suffer from during the university. Furthermore, I will keep listening to ‘TED tech’ on ‘Apple Podcast’ on a daily basis, especially when I work out, to broaden my technical knowledge. Not only that, for my further future, before internship programs in senior year, I will thoroughly prepare myself by getting one of the programming certificates that I can utilize C language. I am not so sure yet which could be the one, but I am surely planning to take an exam for the certificate in a semester break in my third year. Moreover, as I mentioned in reflection 2, I will participate in class actively by answering the lecturers’ questions and asking what I am curious about as well because it helps me to gain unexpected information even if they are trivial questions. At the end of my 4 years of study in RMIT, I will do an internship for my future job because these days most corporations regard internship programs very important. I can experience a realistic workplace in technology areas before getting my own job as well. I hope I can learn all valuable experiences from 4 years of my university life in RMIT through these specific plans.
