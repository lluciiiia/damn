 In the first class, the lecture was about the introduction of this course. First, we started the class by sharing my future plans related to my major with my classmates. On the basis of our majors in the class, we went through all the programs in School of Science and Technology on Rmit website. Furthermore, there was an explanation of ‘Minors’ and honestly, I could not understand it perfectly as it was unfamiliar to me. Finally, the lecture was finished with several recommendations of club activities and primary contacts according to administration, course and program areas. In the next class, I learnt how to organise my Github blog as well as the basic information about the library in Rmit. To be honest, it was my first time to experience coding, but it was quite interesting as I coded several things by myself such as attaching my profile image, which encouraged me to immerse myself in coding in the rest of the class.

 Overall, I can say it was definitely a successful learning experience for me because I could know deeper into the little details of my long-term plan for my career by researching my major before entering the university. Especially when I talked about why I chose my major and what I desire about my career in the future after graduation, I was recalling the motivation for my choice of Software Engineering as my major that I got for the first time when I chose this major, which helped me to reset my loose mind. In addition, the contacts to several offices in Rmit that I learnt from the class helped me to know where I have to go to ask the questions about my exchange program, but it would be better if I knew I have to book an appointment before going to the office right away. Besides, even though it was my first time to code on the website, I thought editing Github is a good way for beginners to learn coding because it is not a boring process of making my own blog. 

 In brief, I was stimulated by the information I learnt from the first class to study hard in the university and consequently, I could have fun when I coded for the first time. In fact, making my own blog on Github made me more interested in coding as well.
