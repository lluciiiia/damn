 I had a class about analytical thinking and effective communication on 29 August, 2022. The lecturer was Peter who was my previous lecturer as well. The contents of the class were quite similar to before, especially how to avoid plagiarism. Nonetheless, I felt I had to study more about it during the class as when I wrote an argument about the safety of AI development, I slightly deviated from the topic to the benefits of AI development. Moreover, it lacked evidence as well as citation, which was stamped on my memory at that moment so that I can write them in next arguments. In addition, it was useful for me to learn when I have to use direct quotes and avoid overusing them. If a phrase is really famous as much as everyone knows, it is weird to paraphrase it rather than direct quotes, which means sometimes, direct quotes are much more accurate than paraphrasing. Furthermore, I learnt another new one, which was that simple paraphrasing shows how much we understand, however, the original meaning must be kept. The key point was we should not make them more complicated than original sentences. Before the class, I was trying to show a range of vocabularies I know by making them more complex. I learnt about the new information about in-text citation by asking questions to the lecturer after a chunking activity, which was there is no penalty when I mention only an acronym of an organisation without the full name. I felt it is really important to ask some questions during the class because even if it is not an exact content of the class, I can gain other information unexpectedly. Not only that, I also learnt from my classmates to engage in the class by giving opinions and answering questions of the lecturer actively, so I tried to answer every trivial question from the lecturer and it worked well. Finally, the lecture was finished with one huge activity, Synthesis Activity, which let me pick the most important information from each of the 4 sources and combine or remove them. Personally, I found it quite difficult to do them because of two reasons, which are I could not compare each source well and did not know how to combine the common information smoothly, but actually it was really simple. For example, we can synthesise two sources like ‘(Source 3&4).’
