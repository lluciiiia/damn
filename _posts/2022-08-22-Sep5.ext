On 5 September 2022, I took a class about engagement and effective oral communication. I learnt details about a good presentation depending on the audience with group members. First of all, we had an activity about the information that I have to provide, following each purpose such as to instruct and to motivate, which made me know how to organize the structure of the presentation well. For example, if I have to motivate others during the presentation, it will be better to tell several personal stories to impress the audience rather than to offer specific evidence about the topics. Then, we practiced how to adjust the level of the information according to the audience. For instance, for high level listeners, we can use acronyms and  terminologies, whereas those in low level would need every single detailed explanation of those terms. By distinguishing high, medium and low levels of the description, I could be familiar with how to prepare the information before my next presentation assignment. Furthermore, we analyzed a variety of slide designs as well as the design of graphs with regard to specifically color contrast between font and background, suitable images, bullet points, and proper effect. It was definitely useful for me to prepare the next assignment since the lecturer’s advice particularly about the graph design was what I have not thought before, which was ‘Always get rid of shadows and gridlines of graphs to look at them easier’, ‘put the name on the pie chart’, and ‘highlight the information that I want to describe.’ Moreover, I knew for the first time that 3D effects for the lind graphs are not good for the audience to identify the key information. Besides, there were some simple contents in the class such as the attitude during the presentation and graph description. I learnt some of them from elementary school such as keeping eye contact with the audience and thanking them at the end of the presentation. However, even though I studied how to elaborate diverse graphs, I gained a few new phrases such as ‘whilst’, ‘at a steady rate’, and ‘the least popular of.’
